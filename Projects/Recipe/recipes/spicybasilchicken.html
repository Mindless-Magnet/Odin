    <p>Ready in 30 minutes. Here's a Thai-inspired meal that's great for weeknights. Pieces of skinless, boneless chicken breast are sautéed with garlic and chile pepper flakes and cooked briefly with mushrooms, onions, and a little oyster sauce</p>
    <p>An authentic taste of Thailand. Served best over white rice.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
